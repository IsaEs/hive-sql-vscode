# hive-sql

This extension provides Hive SQL support for VSCode. The language specification is from the [hive-sublime-text](https://github.com/glinmac/hive-sublime-text) project, with slight modifications by me.

## Features

Enables syntax highlighting and formatting for Hive SQL, including user-defined functions. The screenshot below is using the wonderful [Monokai Dark Soda](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AdamCaviness.theme-monokai-dark-soda) theme. This is my first extension, and contributions are welcome, via GitHub.
